            <h3>INNERVISIONS</h3>
                <br>
                Visions and ideas in the making
                <br>
                <br>
                Innervisions is an electronic music label. It was founded by Steffen Berkhahn, aka Dixon, and Kristian Rädle and Frank Wiedemann of Âme, in 2005. Together they form Innervisions’ unique audio-visual universe. With Berlin as its home, Innervisions evolves from within the city and evokes impressions from all over the world with its releases. Yet Innervisions‘ name reflects something more personal. It reflects the intuitive push toward certain ideas. The name was chosen out of the belief that all art forms, not just music, are a materialized sphere of ideas. The encounter with such a materialized sphere of ideas in a book, an exhibition or a track triggers certain sensations and sensibilities. Following on from this, an inner vision not only allows sensations and sensibilities to evolve inside one’s mind. It keeps on spinning from there to generate new ideas.

                <br>
                Permanent travelling helps the Innervisions crew to stay engaged in the loop of generating new ideas. Whether continent-hopping from Bogotá to Bombay or taking a train ride from Mönchengladbach to Arnhem, the loop does not start with a deliberate search. Like finding a coin in a pool of mud, it’s about letting yourself be thrown into situations where spotting the precious comes by chance. In January 2010, Dixon travelled to India for the first time. In Mumbai he went to Crawford Market, letting the traders drag him from stall to stall. Finally he ended up sat down on exactly the roll of cotton fabric that would become Innervisions’ iconic 2010 shawl: checkered with hand-stitched, polymorphic flowers in colours so sharp they could almost poke your eyes out. Yet what turned a piece of cotton into a shawl – or a fabric into an Innervisions fabrication – was the logo: not just a print on a big ugly tag, but a hand-stitched red rectangle that blends into the lovely loudness of the shawl without disrupting it. That the rectangle spelled out the label’s name was only visible at second glance.

                An example closer to the core of Innervisions’ productions is the release of Dele Sosimi Afrobeat Orchestra’s “Too much information” remixes right at the end of 2015. In a year when Frankey & Sandrino’s “Acamar” effortlessly scored one superlative after the next, “Too much Information” could have been just that: too much, diverting attention. Yet the far less driving, less swirly and quirky, but heavy in agendas track is evocative of Innervisions’ diverse roots. It’s a testimonial to the auditory amicability the label has cultivated toward West- and South-African influences, encountered not only by travelling but by imbibing through the senses in clubs, bars, museums and friends’ kitchens. So “Too much information” was picked up because it beautifully reflects many aspects of Innervisions’ journeys: the courage to transgress genres, to disrupt trends, to give in to impulsiveness and to taste the untasted. What’s more, all these aspects demonstrate an ignorance toward planned hits.</h2>
